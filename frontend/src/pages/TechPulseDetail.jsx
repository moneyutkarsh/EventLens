    content: `
      Hackathons are no longer just fun weekend coding challenges. They‚Äôve become career accelerators, 
      networking hubs, and innovation launchpads. Many successful startups like **Devfolio, HackerRank, 
      and even Instagram** started as hackathon ideas.
      
      Developers benefit by:
      - Learning new skills under pressure.
      - Building real-world projects in days.
      - Meeting mentors, recruiters, and investors.
      - Landing jobs or even starting companies.

    title: "The Rise of AI Tools in Everyday Coding",
    content: `
      AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Tabnine, and Replit Ghostwriter are transforming coding. 
      Instead of writing every line from scratch, developers now collaborate with AI to write, debug, 
      and optimize code.
      
      Benefits:
      - Faster prototyping.
      - Smarter debugging and suggestions.
      - Leveling the field for beginner developers.
      
      But with great power comes responsibility‚ÄîAI-driven code also raises questions about plagiarism, 
      intellectual property, and over-reliance.

      AI is both a shield and a sword in cybersecurity. Attackers use AI to create sophisticated 
      phishing emails, malware, and deepfakes, while defenders use AI to detect anomalies, stop 
      threats in real-time, and predict attacks before they happen.
      
      Key concerns:
      - Data privacy and protection.
      - Ethical AI use.
      - Global collaboration for secure AI.

      Web3 is reshaping the internet with decentralization, blockchain, and ownership at its core. 
      Developers entering Web3 can build **dApps, NFTs, DAOs, and smart contracts**. 
      
      Why Web3 is exciting:
      - Decentralized finance (DeFi) is booming.
      - NFTs are expanding into gaming, real estate, and art.
      - DAOs are redefining governance models.
      
      Skills you need: Solidity, Rust, blockchain fundamentals, and an open mindset.
